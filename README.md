# The Great Refactoring

I have learned a lot of things since I began this project, namely what my algorithms are capable of, and more importantly, **not capable of**. In order to sculpt deltastar to meet my vision, I need to refactor the entire code base. Thus, you can think of this project in its current state as a proof of concept.

Like I mentioned before, deltastar in its current state only offers rewrite rule compilation. However, I wish it to be more than that, which is why I've decided to not publish it to Pypi yet. Details for the sweeping changes are outlined in TODO.md.
