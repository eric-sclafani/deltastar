# TODO

This file contains personal notes, planned additions, random ideas, etc..

## Currently working on:

- 

## Planned optimizations:
I plan to refactor the code base to be more scalable, readable, and modular. Changes could include, but not limited to:
- Implement operations over regular relations (concateation, union, composition)
- Restructure how the user's input is handled
- I want to get rid of the three factory function style 
- Remove dictonary for delta
- Greatly improve and simplify transition generation
    - this especially includes prefix transitions
- Improve how word boundary symbols are handled
- Pynini interaction

## Planned additions:

- Probablty switch out `Pydot` for either `networkx` or `PyGraphviz` and generate an actual dot file instead of directly converting into a png (Pydot seems to be deprecated, so I might want to switch to a more maintained package)

- simutaneous application, left-to-right, right-to-left
